   - Mitigation: Implement abstraction layers and adapters to isolate API-specific code

2. **Performance Issues**
   - Risk: Tools perform poorly with large projects or complex requests
   - Mitigation: Implement performance monitoring and optimization, use caching where appropriate

3. **Integration Challenges**
   - Risk: Difficulties integrating with Claude Desktop
   - Mitigation: Regular testing with Claude Desktop, maintain close communication with Claude team

4. **Security Concerns**
   - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in file operations or command execution
   - Mitigation: Implement strict validation and sandboxing, regular security reviews

5. **Cost Management**
   - Risk: Excessive API costs due to high usage
   - Mitigation: Implement cost tracking and limits, optimize API usage

## Success Criteria

The OptimusCode MCP server will be considered successful when:

1. Claude Desktop can generate complete applications from start to finish based on user requests
2. The system is stable, performant, and secure
3. API costs are reasonable and predictable
4. Users can customize and extend the system as needed
5. Documentation is comprehensive and up to date

## Conclusion

This development roadmap provides a structured approach to implementing the OptimusCode MCP server. By following this roadmap, we can transform Claude Desktop into a fully automated app generator that can build applications from start to finish based on user requests.

The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, ensuring that each component is solid before moving on to the next. Regular reviews and adjustments to the roadmap will be necessary as development progresses and requirements evolve.
