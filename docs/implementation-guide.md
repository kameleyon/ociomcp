## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Implement `ContextManager` to handle context window limitations
2. Implement `PathEnforcer` to ensure proper directory structure
3. Implement `CodeSplitter` to enforce component-based architecture
4. Set up OpenRouter API client for API-dependent tools

### Phase 2: Code Generation and Management

1. Implement `CodeFixer` for automatic code issue resolution
2. Implement `PlanCreator` for detailed project planning
3. Implement `ChatInitiator` for seamless session transitions
4. Implement `ToneAdjuster` for appropriate communication style

### Phase 3: API-Dependent Tools

2. Implement `CodeAnalyzer` for AI-assisted refactoring
3. Implement `AIConnector` for specialized AI model integration

## Testing Strategy

For each implemented tool:

1. Create unit tests to verify core functionality
2. Develop integration tests to ensure compatibility with other tools
3. Perform end-to-end testing with Claude Desktop
4. Validate against the requirements in the comprehensive tools suite

## Monitoring and Maintenance
