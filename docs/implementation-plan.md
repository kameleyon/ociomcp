## Implementation Priorities

1. **First Phase**: Complete the implementation of all partially implemented tools and implement the Automated Tools
2. **Second Phase**: Implement the core On-Demand Tools for file management, UI generation, and documentation
3. **Third Phase**: Implement the remaining On-Demand Tools for testing, database, and project organization
4. **Fourth Phase**: Implement the API-Dependent Tools

## API Integration Notes

For tools requiring API integration, use the OpenRouter API with the following key:
```
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
```

The model to use is: `anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet`

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Keep all files under 500 lines
2. Use component-based architecture with small, manageable components
3. Fix TypeScript errors manually without creating extra files or scripts
4. Do not use emojis - use Lucid React icons or other icon libraries
5. Do not create unnecessary test environments, files, folders, or scripts
