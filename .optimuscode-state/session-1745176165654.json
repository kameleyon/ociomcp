So far, I've created the basic file structure in C:\\Users\\Administrator\\myAPP\\hourglass and implemented index.html with a modern UI, styles.css with custom animations and styling based on their color palette, app.js with full countdown functionality, and a README.md. The app features event creation/editing, custom color themes, responsive design, local storage for events, and visual alerts for approaching deadlines. The app uses a color palette with Charcoal (#2F4858), Lapis Lazuli (#33658A), Carolina Blue (#86BBD8), Hunyadi Yellow (#F6AE2D), and Orange Pantone (#F26419).",
