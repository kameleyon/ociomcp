## Next Steps

1. Implement the project planning functionality (Phase 2 in ROADMAP.md)
2. Develop the testing framework integration
3. Add UI generation capabilities
4. Implement version control and history features
5. Create comprehensive documentation
6. Publish to npm for easier installation
